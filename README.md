# Getting Everything Up and Running
- First make sure that you've cloned the repo
- Next we want to cd into the frontend folder and start the server by running the following command:
```javascript
  npm run start
```
- Now open the backend folder and start the server by running the following command:
```javascript
  npm run start:dev
```
